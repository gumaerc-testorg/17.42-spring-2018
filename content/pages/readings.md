Introduction

*Do regular laws of motion govern international politics? If so, how can we identify them? And how can we explain specific events, like wars? Can we use methods like those of the natural sciences?*

\[Z\] Chapter 15: Disarmament.

*A basic discussion of limiting arms as a solution to war. Discussed are (1) "quantitative disarmament" ("let's have fewer weapons!"); and (2) qualitative disarmament ("let's have fewer weapons of certain types: specifically, fewer offensive weapons, fewer weapons that are optimized for striking first; and fewer indiscriminate weapons that inflict unintended collateral harm on civilians.")*

*Ziegler says that it is impossible to limit offensive arms while permitting defensive arms. Is that true?*

Schelling, Thomas C. "The Dynamics of Mutual Alarm." Chapter 6 in *Arms and Influence*. Yale University Press, 2008. ISBN: 9780300143379. 

*The classic statement of "stability theory," which posits that war is more likely when the side that strikes first has the advantage. States will then launch war in hopes of gaining the first-strike advantage, or denying it to their adversary, especially if they expect war.*

Narang, Vipin. "{{% resource_link "ac13e0c0-ba27-4da2-961c-5efbe5c218bc" "Why Kim Jong Un Wouldn't Be Irrational to Use a Nuclear Bomb First" %}}," *Washington Post,* September 8, 2017.

*An extension of the stability theory argument outlined in the previous reading by Schelling, "Dynamics of Mutual Alarm," to a current crisis. Narang warns that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un may conclude that striking first with nuclear weapons is his best option if he thinks war is inevitable. If so, is the U.S. wise to take steps (e.g., threatening tweets or a "bloody nose" limited attack) to convince Kim that he faces war?*

Blainey, Geoffrey. "Dreams and Delusions of a Coming War." Chapter 3 in *The Causes of War.* 3rd edition. Free Press, 1988, ISBN: 9780029035917. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "e3ffe250-c49c-4502-9fa7-7e739b1dfa33" "Google Books" %}}\]

*False optimism about the likely results of war causes war.*

*Your instructor summarizes the argument that states are more belligerent and war is more likely when conquest is easy. A related argument: international conflict arises largely from the "security dilemma"-the tendency of states to threaten others' security by their efforts to secure themselves.*

*Can war be prevented by making conquest hard among potential belligerents? If so, how could this be done?*

*A classic discussion of the delusions to which states are prone. Is Jervis' list of myopias a good one? Do they arise from the psychological sources he stresses, or are other causes at work?*

*Some say conflict is best resolved by the carrot, while using the stick merely provokes; others would use the stick, warning that using the carrot ("appeasement") emboldens others to make more demands. Who's right? Probably both--but under what circumstances? and how can you tell which circumstances you are in?*

*The theories of militarism and nationalist mythmaking are summarized here, and applied to the question of whether there will be war in contemporary Europe.*

*Militarism theory proposes that professional militaries sometimes cause war by infusing society with organizationally self-serving bellicist ideas that persuade civilians to go to war.*

*Nationalist mythmaking theory proposes that societies often infuse themselves with self-glorying, self- exculpating and other-blaming myths, especially by teaching chauvinist nationalist history in school; these myths promote conflict and war.*

———. "A World of Terror." Chapter 12 in *The Age of Sacred Terror: Radical Islam's War Against America*. Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2003. ISBN: 9780812969849. 

*Chapter 2, pp. 38–55, 62–68, and 91–94, describes the Islamist currents of thinking that spawned Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda. al-Qaeda's violence stems from a stream of Islamist thought going back to ibn Taymiyya, a bellicose Islamic thinker from the 13th century; to Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792), the harsh and rigid shaper of modern Saudi Arabian Islam; to Rashid Rida (1866-1935) and Hassan al-Banna (?-1949); and above all to Sayyid Qutb (?-1966), the shaper of modern Islamism. Taymiyya, al-Wahhab and Qutb are covered here. Covered also (pp. 91-94) is the frightening rise of apocalyptic thinking in the Islamic world. What causes the murderous thinking described here?*

*Chapter 12 covers the phenomenon of millenarianism (apocalyptic thinking) in other religions--Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity. This violent, even genocidal (globacidal?) form of religious thought has appeared widely in the last three decades. Why? How can it be tamed before it is used to justify great horrors?*

Manji, Irshad. "{{% resource_link "1a06f1eb-95ed-4c84-b15e-156ff8d05d84" "Is Islam to Blame? Despite Claims of Moderate Muslims, a Literal Reading of the Koran Offers Cover for Acts of Terrorism" %}}," *Los Angeles Times,* July 22, 2005.

*The Koran contains hateful passages and passages that incite to violence. What to do about them? Is it ok for Muslims to continue to declare that the entire Koran is the sacred word of God? What about Manji's suggestion that Muslims confess some "sins of Scripture"? Should all religions do this?*

Ahmed, Issam. "{{% resource_link "8d225651-b185-426e-8b45-9ad6d89cf894" "Pakistan: Do School Texts Fuel Bias?" %}}," *Christian Science Monitor*, January 21, 2009.

*Pakistan is rife with religious militancy and has an aggressive foreign policy. Some say the problem starts with Pakistani schoolbooks.*

*Christians who are followers of premillennial dispensationalism oppose an Israel-Palestinian peace settlement. Their larger objective: destroying the world. Isn't that special.*

*Polygamy causes war by intensifying competition for wealth among men, which causes violence (see, e.g., bloody conflicts for cattle in South Sudan). Polygamy also makes for cruel, dysfunctional families and for child abuse. Some abused children then become abusers themselves. So it goes.*

*Global warming will cause war. Specifically, warming will create vast flooding and desertification, which will create hordes of refugees, who will clash with those in their new host-countries. Warming will also open new conflicts between states, who will quarrel over newly-valuable mineral rights in the now-ice-free arctic. What fun! And another happy thought: will warming create a new rationale for anti-western WMD terror by societies that are destroyed by warming and blame the industrial west for causing it?*

*Forty armed conflicts were ongoing in 27 places worldwide in 2014, when the data reported here was collected. Of these 40 conflicts, 11 have seen at least 1000 battle deaths and thus rise to the level or "wars," using the common definition. Conflicts are fewer than the post-1945 peak year of 1991 (when 51 conflicts were ongoing), but more than the trough year of 2010, (31 ongoing) and far more than 1946 (17 ongoing). Annual battle deaths reached a post-Cold War peak in 2014 at 101,400, due largely to the great violence of the Syrian civil war. However, fatalities are still lower than during the second half of the last century, which saw great bloodletting in several episodes (the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Angola, Iran-Iraq, Congo, and Ethiopia-Eritrea).*

*Nearly all conflicts today are civil conflicts--in fact only one "international" conflict was underway in 2014 (India-Pakistan). This is a huge change from the centuries before 1945, when most war was between states. But many civil wars today are "internationalized"-- troops from foreign states are involved--so they are fueled by international conflict even though they occur within one state. Thirteen of the 39 internal conflicts ongoing in 2014 were "internationalized," an all time high. These thirteen include the conflicts in Congo, Ukraine, Yemen, Iraq, Somalia, South Sudan, and Afghanistan. Yet interstate war has undeniable abated. Why has this happened? Could interstate war make a comeback? Many worry about scenarios involving Korea, Iran, and U.S.-China.*

*Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II was very powerful and profoundly neurotic. He was crippled, abused, and unloved as a child. As an adult he was naricissistic, given to intense rages, unable to focus for long on anything, and easily manipulated by others. He ruled Germany during 1888–1918. What could possibly go wrong?*

*Geiss's book summarizes the views of the "Fischer School" of German historiography. Fischerites argue that Germany desired and deliberately provoked a general European war in 1914. Geiss draws heavily on Fritz Fischer's 1969 book* War of Illusions, *which is the cornerstone work of the "Fischer School" of German historiography*.

*Pages 121–27 cover German "encirclement and self- isolation." Was there a Jervis-type spiral between Germany and its neighbors?*

*Pages 128–37 cover Germany's offensive against encirclement, including its effort to ensure British neutrality in a continental war; and also rising crazed German public attitudes.*

*Pages 142–45 recount the December 8, 1912 War Council meeting, at which some observers argue the German elite decided to launch war in 1914.*

*Pages 146–50 recount what some observers argue were German actions to prepare for the war that was decided at the 12/8/12 War Council--specifically, a German military buildup, and an effort to prepare the German public for war.*

*Pages 163–66 describe the German "blank checks" to Austria, which incited Austria to launch war on Serbia in July 1914.*

*Strachan, an anti-Fischerite, thinks that the December 8, 1912 War Council was no war council at all, but rather an indecisive bull session of sorts. Are his reasons persuasive?*

*In the debate between Fischerites and anti-Fischerites, who is right? How aggressive was Germany? Did it desire war? Did it provoke WWI?*

*The militaries of Europe caused the war. They lobbied hard for war. Through propaganda they also purveyed bellicist ideas that persuaded European civilians to favor war. Most important among these bellicist ideas was the "cult of the offensive," a Europe-wide belief that conquest was easy and the offense was strong.*

\[R\] Chapter 6: Slowing Science Down? 

*The advance of science has a fearsome byproduct: we are discovering ever more powerful means of destruction. These destructive powers are being democratized: the mayhem that only major states can do today may lie within the capacity of millions of individuals in the future unless we somehow change course. Deterrence works against states but will fail against crazed non- state organizations or individuals. How can the spread of destructive powers be controlled?*

*The wolf that worried Henry Kelly--new ultra- lethal biotechnology (see previous reading)--is at our door. Recent advances in gene editing, embodied in the CRISPR editing method, will spread the power to create new bioagents hither and yon, including to nihilistic terrorists and psychopaths. The only way to reliably prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is deterrence, but these bad actors are not deterrable. U.S. director of national intelligence James Clapper warned of this danger in 2016, declaring CRISPR--a product of the U.S. scientific community--to be a threat to U.S. national security. Wow! Has the bioengineering science community created a grave threat?*
